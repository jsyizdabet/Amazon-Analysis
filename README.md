# Amazon-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of over 1.000 products listed on Amazon and building a recommendation system for these products.
The dataset includes details such as product name, category, price, rating, and user reviews.
The goal of this project is to understand customer preferences, identify purchasing patterns, and develop a recommendation system to suggest products to users based on their interests.

*This project will consist of the following steps :*

1. Data Collection : Collect the Amazon products dataset from Kaggle.
2. Data Preparation : Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis : Analyze the data to understand the distribution of products by categories, customer ratings, and reviews.
4. Data Visuallization : Visualize the data to identify trends and patterns
